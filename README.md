### :wave: Greetings

My name is David, a Designer and Illustrator for the last 15+ years. 

I'd been working with HTML and CSS for quite a long time, but in December 2020 I decided to take the plunge and join a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered through UT-Austin. I'm currently employed full-time as a Senior Product Designer at [Bevy](https://bevy.com), but I hope to continue to hone my development chops and am looking to potentially switch to more of a front-end development role in the future.
