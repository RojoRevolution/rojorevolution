### :wave: Greetings

My name is David, a Designer and Illustrator for the last 15+ years. 

In March 2021, I completed a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered through UT-Austin. So I can now not only design web products, but build them as well. I am hoping to transition my career to working full-time in web developemt.
