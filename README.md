### :wave: Greetings

My name is David, a Designer and Illustrator for the last 15+ years. 

I've been working with HTML and CSS for quite a long time, but in December 2020 I decided to take the plunge and join a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered through UT-Austin. I'm currently employed full-time as a Web Designer, but I hope to continue to hone my development chops when time permits.
