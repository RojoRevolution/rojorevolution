### :wave: Greetings

My name is David, a Designer and Illustrator for the last 15+ years. 

I'm currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered through UT-Austin so I can not only design web products, but build them as well. The bootcamp course is set to end in late March 2021, and I am hoping to transition my career to working full-time in web developemt.
